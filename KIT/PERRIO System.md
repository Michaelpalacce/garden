PERRIO does not really seem like anything special. Seems like this is what normally people do when they are building a [[Obsidian - PKM|PKM]].


# Priming

This is the main learning event.

> [!quote]
> Activity you do before you encounter a topic.

Helps our brain to filter the information.

# Encoding

Techniques that will allow your brain to organize and process the information better

- Grouping 
- Simplifying 
- Analogies
- Connections
- Intuitive

# Reference

Taking information and putting it somewhere to access later. A brain dump for information you don't want to bother with while you are encoding and processing.

This could be software ([[000 Obsidian Index|Obsidian]]) or a piece of paper.

# Retrieval

Test your ability to use your knowledge.

Helps you with reprocessing and repackaging.

# Interleaving

Approaching a topic from various angles or perspectives.

# Overlearning

Learning more than you need to. Going deeper into a topic to achieve a higher standard of mastery
