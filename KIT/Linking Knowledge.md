# Whole Files

Prefer using whole files by default, so you can easily dig deeper into the problem only if needed. 

```
[[Some Note]] 
```

# Headers

Headers should be used to provide full context to what is being linked, as they usually contain enough data to make a complete point. Using `#header` allows you to link headers.

# Blocks

Blocks should be used to point to something that is super specific or just to quote a part of a note. Using `^whatever-text` will allow you to create links to blocks. This is a great feature and it's very useful, but we should be careful as they may get easily broken by mistake
