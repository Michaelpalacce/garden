> [!success] Concept
> In today's day and age, **given the amount of compelling works** that **need our attention**, we are **limited in how much we can actually ingest**.

This backs up the idea of keeping a [[PKM|Second Brain]]. 

**Important information** needs to be [[How To Retain Knowledge|retained]].

**Don't [[Learning|learn]] for the sake of remembering everything**, but to form [[Linking Your Thinking|links]] and [[Stimulating New Ideas|stimulate new ideas]].

[[You Can't Remember Everything]] and that's OK.

*Should everything be committed to notes then? Maybe we don't need to add all the information in the world.*
