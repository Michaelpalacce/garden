# The Problem Starts 

This is the second most important phase. The beginning is always important, but it does nothing but introduce a problem in your life that you have to solve. 

Remember tho, every mistake, every error, every issue that you face is not wasted if you manage to learn from it. 

## What To Do 

- **Collect data** on what is happening. 
- Be **emphatic**, all you have to do is **gather data** 
- Don't try to suggest solutions, **guessing clouds reason and can lead you on the wrong track** 

# The Debugging 

You've gathered the data, now it's time to examine it. 

## What To Do 

- Try to **ascertain** if what you are **told or what you've observed is actually true**. 
	- [[Sanity Check]] the problem 
- If a reason is given, always do a [[Root Cause Analysis|RCA]], things may not be as they seem. 
- **Tunnel vision is your enemy**
- **Take notes** of what you do 

# The Aftermath 

This is the **most important part**. At this point you've wasted time and resources, and you've not done anything to improve yourself. If you don't **take action now**, that knowledge may not [[Make It Stick|stick]]. You should always **strive to gain knowledge and improve yourself** when the opportunity arises. 

## What To Do 

- **Analyze what you've done** 
- **Write down any missing connections** so if a **similar situation** occurs it will be traced back and potentially **resolved faster**

# When does learning happen? 

> Learning happens when everything goes wrong and you figure it out.
