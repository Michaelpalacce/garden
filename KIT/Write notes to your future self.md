The [[Obsidian - Alias System|Alias System]] can help with this a lot. I tend to **rephrase a problem with aliases**.

**Provide [[Context]]** always, as [[Write Notes For Someone Else|your future self will be missing that]].

**Add [[Obsidian - What Do Bold Characters Mean|boldness]]** to your notes to **extract the important information**. [[Elaboration|Elaborate]]!
