# What Is A MOC

Each MOC groups notes for a particular topic.
MOCs contain content that would be more tightly grouped. 

# Indexes vs MOCs

A MOC becomes and Index when it starts to contain collection of topics spanning from the parent. It is usually a collection of a bunch of other MOCs or indexes. 

Example: 

```
- Knowledge Index 
	- Programming Index 
		- Javascript MOC
			- Javascript - Best Practices 
```
