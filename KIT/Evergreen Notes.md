> A note is evergreen when it is **self-containing**. It **hold all the needed information** to describe an idea, **has a place** in the vault, contains all the **needed metadata**.

# Process

Whenever a note is created, a status of **seed** is added. As the note matures and progresses, the state of the note will keep changing. The `seed` will grow to a **sapling** when we start populating the note with data. The sapling will eventually become a **tree** where it still needs more information added to it, but has become substantial enough. At the end, it joins the **evergreen** forest. After a while, some notes may become **withered**, as they are no longer needed. 

Some notes were never meant to joint the forest. These are **ephemeral** notes and information in them is either not important or temporary, or it should be moved immediately to another place. 

Some notes need a place, but you just can't figure it out atm, so they are put in an **inbox**.

And finally some notes don't really need a place... they are **orphan**s.
