# Prefixes

Prefixes are a way for me to assign specific tree ownership. it's a bit of a thin line when to prefix the note or not.

Some general rules to follow when prefixing:

- Prefix only when the note is related to a specific technology/software/etc
	- Example: 
		- [[Go - JSON]]
			- This is definitely needed as JSON is a concept that is present outside of Go, however I want to outline the specific use of JSON in Go in that note.
		- [[Aria Automation - Cloud Template]]
			- Cloud Templates won't really make much sense outside of Aria Automation, so there we go
- Don't prefix origin/environment
	- Example
		- [[sudo|sudo]]
			- I could have added `Linux -` or `Linux Security - ` but that is not needed.

# Suffixes

Suffixes are a distinction of type/organization/origin

Some general rules to follow when suffixing

- Don't suffix if there is an existing prefix. That prefix should hold enough information
- Prefix to denote organization for people
	- I use it to specify which company people may belong to.
- Prefix the type when working with creative fiction/nonfiction.
	- Things like movies, anime, books, shows, etc
- Suffix when too ambiguous to denote type
	- A great example of this would be quotes
