# Avoid Creating A Hierarchical Folder Structure

When working with my framework, folders are your enemy. Organize the chaos of your garden by linking your ideas, not creating a hierarchy.

## Exceptions

- Plugins that require a specific structure
- Templates
- Periodic Notes
- **Work related notes** as they may require deletion after a while.
- Assets

# Asset Organization

> [!done] ~ Where ? ~
> The Assets are always put inside the `Assets` folder in the root of the project.

This is done by right clicking the assets folder and setting it as an attachment folder.
