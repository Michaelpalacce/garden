> **Utilize your daily note**. There is a section for **quick capture** if things need to be written down fast. 

# Focus on the content, not the structure

- When writing a note, **don't bother with templates** or making sure all the **metadata is filled**.
- You are trying to capture #knowledge and knowledge is #fleeting. If it's not captured fast, then you'll miss the idea. 

# Decide placement later

- The **place can be decided later**. The note can then be retrieved in the [[Command & Control Center Index|C3]] so you'll be able to **dynamically see** what is linked by jumping to that note. 

# Using the right headers is not necessary to capture your idea. 

- They can be added later.
- Notes can be restructured or even split, so there is no point in making sure you have all put together nicely.
