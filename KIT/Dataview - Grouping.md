[[Dataview]]


Using the dataviewjs codeblock, you can do some advanced grouping.

## Map Of Content
- [[Dataview - Grouping of Files|Grouping of Files]] - Group files under a specific directory by something
- [[Dataview - Grouping by State|Grouping by State]] - Group all notes using their state
- [[Dataview - Grouping with Sort|Grouping with Sort]] - Group and sort. Sorting is a bit different in dataview from standard sorts.

## Troubleshooting

### Tags are missing
Restart Obsidian
