> **Interleaved practice** involves **mixing different skills or topics within a single study session**, while **varied practice** focuses on **performing the same skill in different settings and contexts**.
> Both techniques contrast with [[Blocked Practice|blocked practice]] (focusing on one topic at a time) and are effective learning strategies, as they **mimic real-world unpredictability** and **force the brain to differentiate between concepts**, leading to more [[Durable Knowledge|durable learning]] and better [[Long-Term Retention]].

Learning about **more than one thing** at a time and by **switching between topics** regularly we **increase our learning ability**. This method allows our brain to [[Linking Your Thinking|create connections]] by [[Putting Knowledge Into Larger Context|expanding our context]].

[[Spaced Repetition|Spacing out learning]] also gives your brain time to store the information and by continuously [[Continuous Retrieval|Recalling Information]] you gain a benefit of strengthening that knowledge. 

Our brains are made for multitasking.
