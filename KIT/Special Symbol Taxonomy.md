Method of classification and assignment of classifications to a collection. This targets the state of a note and not everything that can go in the [[YAML Front Matter|YAML Frontmatter]] ( Read that for more details )

# Classifying status of notes

Writing [[Evergreen Notes]]!

# Combining multiple special symbols for search

When searching, you should be combining multiple of these special symbols/keywords. This way you can filter out the ones you don't need.

# Types of special symbols

## State Symbols

Symbols that describe the state of the note. These must be added to the `state` [[YAML Front Matter]]
- Progress Tags - Denoting tags that specify the completeness of a note. Only one per note 
	1. **seed** - The note is just a seed. The idea is forming. *Example: Empty note, with properties and a proper place in the vault.*
	2. **sapling** - The note has sprouted from the `seed` and is growing. *Example: added [[Four Dimensional Thinking|relates, opposes and links]]*
	3. **tree** - The note is ready to join the forest, still may need a few more references or improvements. *Example: The note contents have been filled, but there is more information that I'd like to add that is missing.*
	4. **evergreen** - The note has joined the forest. *Example: The note is fully formed and is not expected to change much.*
	5. **withered** - The note is old and has withered away. 
	6. **ephemeral** - notes that should be destroyed, information on them is temporary and is not important at all.
	7. **core** - This is a really special tag. It signals for a significant note in your vault. Notes like these are special and they are few and far between. This is a core topic. 
- Action Tags
	1. **inbox** - The note needs to be placed somewhere in the forest
	2. **orphan** - The note is in the forest and doesn't really need a place for now. They are linked to [[Command & Control Center Index|C3]] ( a general place to control your garden )
	3. **workbench** - a collection for a specific idea or something I'm working on. These are not part of the forest
