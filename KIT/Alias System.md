# Overview

## Alias To Remove Prefixes 

> In my Vault I sometimes prefix a given components with it's parent. In those cases where reasonable, add an alias without the prefix. 

## Write Meaningful Aliases

> Only when something can actually be called something else, an alias should be added. Avoid adding an alias because it makes sense to you. 

## Add Aliases For Search 

> Aliases are a great way to help you search for stuff. **You may forget the name of the tool but not the function**.

Take a look at [[passwd]]. It has an alias for "[[passwd|passwd]]" to allow me to use it directly without the context of Linux and it has an alias "[[passwd|Change User Password]]" for when I'm wondering what the program was that does that. 

## Use Aliases When A Tool Has A Different Name Or Was Renamed

This one is pretty straightforward. 

> If a tool ha multiple names or a recent rename has happened, then it's deserving of an alias to preserve the history.
