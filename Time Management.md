# Automation 

Automating a repetitive task that takes you 5 minutes to do? Even if that task would take 6 hours to automate, consider the benefits. In the long run it'll save you time and it will help you by minimizing interruptions and [[Context Switching]]. 

Automation will also help you with the [[Human Factor]]. Humans make mistakes.
