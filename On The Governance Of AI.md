This came to me after arguing with an acquaintance of mine regarding AI, where I was explaining to her what are the cons of artificial intelligence. 

AI has become an undeniable part of our day to day, to the point where it **has started interfering** with said day to day. You see artists getting scared that they are getting replaced, new developers scared that AI will replace them, senior developers "marveling" at the "quality" that tools like Claude Code and whatnot produce, animators worrying about the current trends in [[Computer Generated Imaging|CGI]]. 

What I, as a father of a (at the time of writing) 4yo daughter, am scared of the most are the implications AI generated and more importantly AI modified images have on my daughter's mental well-being. I just can't live with the inevitable future coming our way, where a picture of my daughter can be taken and modified, put in situations that personally I will leave to the imagination of the reader. 

Do an experiment, try to see if you can run an uncensored image model locally and see how far it will go. I want you, the reader, to try this yourself to understand HOW DISGUSTED I am.

Where is the governance on this? I personally think that image and video generation is a [[Crime Against Humanity]]. Yes, I'm going for grandeur and shock value saying this. 

I see so, so many negatives to AI and with all the recent trends and articles I wonder if I'm the only one. I am not worried about my job being replaced by a calculator with an ego, not worried about the rise of component prices just to run a waste of GPU resources or the fact that our electrical grid is struggling because of a hallucinating hard drive. 

People should speak up and boycott the use of these capabilities.

Do I hate AI after saying all these things? No. I may get into how I use AI in another post, but not this one, not now. 

I'm just a father that wants my child to be safe.
