There are lots of benefits to society, as well as to oneself, in sharing opinions, knowledge, experiences and day-to-day.

Artists share their art. 🧑‍🎨
Photographers their photos. 📷
Musicians their music. 🎶
Writers their stories and books. 📖
Sculptors their creations. 🗿
Developers Open Source their code. 💻

Yes, the note title may be a bit misleading, but the concept is similar in my mind.

Studying, in the literal sense, in public can improve productivity for people who find it hard to focus at home. While there is a lot of hustle and bustle in public places, some people may find the chaos calming. I would argue that the home environment brings a lot more Distractions and Productivity Sinks.

At the same time, there may be a middle ground. And having a blog where I can share my thoughts is just that for me.

So, that’s why I call this studying in public.
