# Know your audience

When speaking to people, make sure you **understand what their technical background** is. A **non-technical person** will **not understand deeply technical problems** and a **technical person** may **not care for business needs**. Don't go into too much low-level details with business stakeholders, but go into deep and precise technical jargon when speaking to fellow engineers.

Make sure to **ask the person(s)** you are talking to **if they already understand** a certain subject. There is no point in going into details they already understand.

# Establish Relevance First

In order to **capture the attention** of the listener, make sure to **describe how the information** you are about to describe **relates to them**.

# Use analogies and storytelling

When explaining highly technical problems to non-technical people, **use analogies**. For example you can **correlate Load Balancing with a hostess** working at a restaurant that seats people to create order and balance the work of the servers. **People learn** and understand **better** when they hear an **interesting analogy or story**.

# Simplify

**Break down complex tasks into tangiable action items**. [[Simplicity]] is always good. Complex topics without any organization and guidance from the architect or [[Tech Lead\|Team Lead]] may be easily misunderstood.

This also [[Tech Lead#Mentorship & Guidance\|empowers developers]] to implement a solution in a way that they think is best.

# Leverage Visual Aids

You can **accompany your explanations** with **diagrams, presentations, flowcharts or models**. This will capture the attention of your audience.

This way you are **using [[There Is No Preferred Learning Style\|two of their senses]] for learning**. 

# Check for understanding

Periodically **ask if your audience understood** what you are talking about.
