This is a story about [[Broadcom]] and a **warning to my peers**. It was something I was thinking about talking to the peers in my current company. 

> [!warning]+ tl;dr
> **Never donate your own code** for free to corporations.

See in my time at said company, I had a lot of significant contributions and one of the biggest one in my opinion was me **in my spare time** driving the [[QA]] automation forward. See, **I wrote the Integration testing framework** that upon my departure was **used by the entire business unit as well as all our internal services we were delivering**. The qa team even named it after me: **STEF** (Software Testing Enterprise Framework)

I want the reader to be aware from the get go:

> [!warning]+
> **I didn't just write it. I was the sole developer maintaining it.** 

**More than 90% of that code base, and 100% of the initial commits, was written outside of work**, without anything but a pat on the back given to me for my efforts. This framework was my passion project, because I disliked how testing was done internally (good old [[ClickOps]]). At the time I was even saying things to myself:
- This is not work, I'm doing it for my own betterment. 
- I'm doing this because I like it. 
- it's to learn. 

And all of these were true statements at the time and still to this day. These are not the issue. 

See I'm a huge believer in [[Invest In Yourself\|investing in one self]]. **What bothers me is not that I donated my work, but rather that I didn't open source it from the get go.** 

What possessed me at the time to not post it externally, but internally only, I don't know. Not only that but I was given the option back in the day to open source it, but was stopped by "upper management".

As I talked about my [[So what if they track me\|tracking and security post]], I like to have an online professional persona in a way and that includes sharing my professional opinions as well as open sourcing projects I consider beneficial to my career. This project would have been great add to my portfolio, so I've added it to my [projects page on my website](https://sgenov.dev/projects#Software%20Testing%20Enterprise%20Framework). 

**So, that is my one and only regret. My own code, donated to a corporation, without any accreditation.**
