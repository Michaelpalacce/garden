# Development

- **Some functions are inherently complex, this is ok**
- If a **piece of code gets really complex** you might want to **consider moving that to another method with a descriptive name**. 
- If a **class gets really complex**, it may be a **sign that you need to introduce a new abstraction** and **move part of the code away** to a different component.
