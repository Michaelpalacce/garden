# Stage One - Manual

- Automation doesn't exist, or if it does it's not heavily used
	- Potentially used by limited few with access
- Bottlenecks come up
- Innovation is slow
- Regressions are common

# Stage Two - Siloed

- Teams are starting to use automation
- Few individuals actually innovate, most just benefit. 
- There is still an over-reliance on tickets and manual work. 
- 

# Stage Three - Centralized

- At this point everyone is seeing the benefits of automation and have adopted it in their workload
- Specialized teams are formed to govern and enforce best practices within teams

# Stage Four - Standardized

- At this point Automation is a core practice and is used for critical internal and external processes
- Automation is no longer a set of scripts scattered within the organization, but are centralized and available to use via self service

# Stage Five - Adaptive

- Automation is ruining in the background responding to incidents, events and other occurrences
- Actions are actively taken autonomously in the background
- In this stage maybe [[Artificial Intelligence\|AI]] agents can help, as operators would explain what they require and agents would make it happen. *What a world we live in*
