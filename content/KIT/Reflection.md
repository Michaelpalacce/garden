**Reflect on issues and events** that happen during the day. **Examine different situations** and think **how you could have handled them better**. [[Try New Things]] next time you encounter that problem.

# Practice Until It Becomes A Reflex

Some information becomes engraved in your mind, the neurological pathways formed and overall [[Durable Knowledge\|the information is very durable]] to the point where recalling it and acting on it become a reflex.

**Recalling information over and over, practicing it over and over is so important to mastery.**

# Actively challenge yourself

Did you do really do x,y or z correctly? Is there **any other way people do things**? Can you **take some inspiration from them**.

# Create goals

Use reflection to **create future goals**. When thinking about a specific event, upon discovery that there is a better way for that event to have been handled, create a goal in your mind (or [[KIT/Command & Control Center Index\|vault]]) to **next time attempt the new solution**.
