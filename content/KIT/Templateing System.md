# Overview

Always use templates when creating a new note. 

## Introduce more templates as needed

If one of the existing templates does not match what you are trying to create, create a new template.

## Maintain old templates

If a change in a template is needed, don't be afraid to do so.

## Don't change all notes when a template change happens.

This will just take a lot of time and it's not necessary.
