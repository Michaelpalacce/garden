> [!info]+ What is SOFA? 
> A principle that states, you should **start doing as many things as you have the ability and desire to do** without any goal of completing it whatsoever. Only thing you should strive for is at the very least coming up with a detailed README of sorts, or finishing the idea fully in your mind.

Working on multiple things at the same time is beneficial to your learning as you gain various degree of experience in all areas. Your brain is made to [[Multitasking\|multitask]], don't be scared. 

It's OK not to like something, after all, [[KIT/I Read To Forget\|we don't have all the time in the world to consume everything]]. Put it off, or put it down and never pick it up again.

Nothing is permanent, [[Time\|time]] is passing, nothing lasts forever. A [[Programming Index\|programming language]] that you are passionate about may be old news by the time you are done learning it, that tool that you really like? Old news. Experiment with your projects, [[Hobbies Index\|hobbies]] and [[Ideas\|ideas]].

The good thing about SOFA is you decide when something is done.
