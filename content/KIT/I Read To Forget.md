This backs up the idea of keeping a [[KIT/PKM\|Second Brain]]. 

**Important information** needs to be [[KIT/How To Retain Knowledge\|retained]].

**Don't [[Learning\|learn]] for the sake of remembering everything**, but to form [[KIT/Linking Your Thinking\|links]] and [[Stimulating New Ideas\|stimulate new ideas]].

[[You Can't Remember Everything]] and that's OK.

*Should everything be committed to notes then? Maybe we don't need to add all the information in the world.*
