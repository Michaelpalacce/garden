> [!info]+
> **Cold storage** is **information that I don't work with often**, while **Hot storage** is one that I **use on a daily basis**. 

When **information is fresh**, when I feel like **I'm done working with it**, I should endeavour to **commit it to the Vault**.

In general when **working outside of your area** of expertise, **always save the knowledge**. Such examples are a perfect opportunity to **go back to a subject you don't touch too often and form new [[KIT/Linking Your Thinking\|links]]**.
