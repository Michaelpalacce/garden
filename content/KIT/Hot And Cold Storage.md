> **Cold storage** is **[[Information]] that I don't work with often**, while **Hot storage** is one that I **use on a daily basis**. 

When **information is fresh**, when I feel like **I'm done working with it**, I should endeavour to **commit it to the Vault**.


We handle a lot of information in our day to day and not everything can or really should be stored. 
- We don't store the names of our friends and colleagues, but we do store their phone numbers. 
- We don't store our home address, but we store (or search) the address of different avenues.
- We don't write notes about random movies or TV shows, but we may take notes about ones that made us thoughtful or sparked some interest
- We don't summarize all articles, but we do the ones that we want to remember.

And this is OK. We [[KIT/I Read To Forget\|are not meant to remember and retain everything]]. 

# Cold Storage

# Conclusion

In general when **working outside of your area** of expertise, **always save the knowledge**. Such examples are a perfect opportunity to **go back to a subject you don't touch too often and form new [[KIT/Linking Your Thinking\|links]]**.
