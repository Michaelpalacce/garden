> **Interleaved practice** involves **mixing different skills or topics within a single study session**, while **varied practice** focuses on **performing the same skill in different settings and contexts**.
> Both techniques contrast with [[Blocked Practice\|blocked practice]] (focusing on one topic at a time) and are effective learning strategies, as they **mimic real-world unpredictability** and **force the brain to differentiate between concepts**, leading to more [[Durable Knowledge\|durable learning]] and better [[Long-Term Retention]].

Learning about **more than one thing** at a time and by **switching between topics** regularly we **increase our learning ability**. This method allows our brain to [[KIT/Linking Your Thinking\|create connections]] by [[KIT/Putting Knowledge Into Larger Context\|expanding our context]].

[[Spaced Repetition\|Spacing out learning]] also gives your brain time to store the information and by continuously [[KIT/Continuous Retrieval\|Recalling Information]] you gain a benefit of strengthening that knowledge. 

Our brains are made for multitasking.
