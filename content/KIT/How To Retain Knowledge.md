You've done it! You've **written down your thoughts, ideas, and notes**. Now it's time to **solidify that knowledge**.

# Review Your Notes

After a day of capturing notes, it's time to **review them**. This is the time to **revisit the information** and **make sure it's understandable**.

# Extract Evergreen Notes

During the span of **your day** you may have **outlined an idea or may have solved a problem**, consider **moving that to an evergreen note** and **placing it in the correct place** in your garden.

# Create Links

Don't forget that the most important part of your garden is that **everything is inter-connected**. Notes are and should be [[KIT/Linking Your Thinking\|linked together]], just like the **neurological pathways inside of your brain**. You think with links, so should your second brain.

# Ask Questions

Asking questions for a specific subject, helps form durable knowledge. Questions present a problem and a [[KIT/Learning By Troubleshooting\|problem presents a learning opportunity]]. Use questions in your notes and answer those questions.
