**There is nothing wrong with adding a bunch of links at the bottom of the file. You can expand later on. **

# North - Where X Comes From

This is why I usually add the Parent links.

Furthermore I try to add sources when possible

# West - What's Similar To X

These are the links that are made along the way. Additional Links may be provided in the [[KIT/YAML Front Matter\|YAML Frontmatter]].

# East - What's Opposite Of X

*This is something I am currently lacking. It's not something really beneficial, but it is something that can be added.*

# South - Where x Leads to

These should be conclusions that are made inside the note.
