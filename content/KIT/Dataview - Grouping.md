Using the dataviewjs codeblock, you can do some advanced grouping.

## Map Of Content
- [[KIT/Dataview - Grouping of Files\|Grouping of Files]] - Group files under a specific directory by something
- [[KIT/Dataview - Grouping by State\|Grouping by State]] - Group all notes using their state
- [[KIT/Dataview - Grouping with Sort\|Grouping with Sort]] - Group and sort. Sorting is a bit different in dataview from standard sorts.
