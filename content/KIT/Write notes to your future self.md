The [[KIT/Alias System\|Alias System]] can help with this a lot. I tend to **rephrase a problem with aliases**.

**Provide [[Context]]** always, as [[KIT/Write Notes For Someone Else\|your future self will be missing that]].

**Add [[KIT/What Do Bold Characters Mean\|boldness]]** to your notes to **extract the important information**. [[KIT/Elaboration\|Elaborate]]!
