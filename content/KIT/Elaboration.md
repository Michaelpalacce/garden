> [!note]+
> Elaboration is the process of giving material that you learn **new meaning** by **expressing it in your own words** and **connecting it with what you already know**.

When **data is extracted** from your surrounding world, that information **should be written in your own words**, rather than quoting or paraphrasing. When you are **reading back** what you've captured, that **information should be understandable by you** and nobody else.

# Why Elaborate?
