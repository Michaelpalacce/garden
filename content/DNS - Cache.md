# On The Server

The DNS servers usually cache resolutions. Each server has a different way of handling this

# On The Client

## In The Browser

- Browsers will cache DNS requests.
	- For example for brave: [link](brave://net-internals/#dns)

## On The OS Level

- Different [[Operating System\|operating systems]] cache the DNS requests.
