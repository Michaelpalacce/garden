## Software Design vs System Design

System design refers to design of whole systems/infrastructures, while software design refers to the design of a specific software of a system. 

# Software Design Principles

- Coupling
	- [[Loose Coupling]]
	- [[Tight Coupling]]
- [[High Cohesion]]

# Software Design Paradigms

- [[Functional Programming\|Functional Programming]] - functions as first class citizens, like [[Haskell]]
	- [[Pure Functions\|Pure Functions]] are functions that operate purely only within their scope and do not modify any external components.
- [[OOP\|Object Oriented Programming]] - focused on classes and objects, like [[Java]]
- [[Procedural Programming]] - focuses on procedures or routines, like [[C]]
- [[Declarative Programming]] - focused on what should be fine, not how, like [[SQL]]
- [[Event Driven Archtiecture]] - responds to user events or actions, like [[Javascript]]
