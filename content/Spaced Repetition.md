Spaced repetition is the **only effective form** of [[Repetition\|repetition]], usually **with the help of flashcards**, and can be used to [[KIT/Continuous Retrieval\|strengthen]] the **retrieval of information**. 

The general difference is the process of which repetition is done. In spaced repetition, **questions are prepared by you for you**, with the aim to **extract core knowledge** that will **help revitalize** your [[KIT/Linking Your Thinking\|connections]] that may or may not have been lost. 

*From personal experience this is a semi effective method of learning for me.*
