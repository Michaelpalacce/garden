# Hasty Work - Shame For The Craftsman

> A poorly translated proverb from Bulgarian, that essentially means when you rush, the resulting work is not up to par. 

In In my opinion, people learn best by [[KIT/Learning By Troubleshooting\|troubleshooting]], as I've noted before in my [[KIT/Framework]]. This is because [[Make It Stick#Rules of learning\|effort]] leads to [[Learning]] and [[Durable Knowledge]]. 

![[KIT/Learning By Troubleshooting#When does learning happen?]]

**Putting an effort** into reading the documentation 📖, researching an issue or even brainstorming the best way to go about a problem **will only benefit you**. **Going the easy and fast way will benefit others** (maybe [[Corporate\|Corporations]]). 

Let's give some other examples of this:
- **In school, cheating on a test** will not benefit you in life
- **At work, not [[Meeting Minutes#Prepare Ahead\|preparing for a meeting]],** will lead you to stumbling and leaving a bad impression on others
- **In conversations with your peers, not being able to make a point and defaulting to "Let me ask AI"** for every topic would make you seem like a fool

# How To Know You've Lost Your Edge

**For Developers, turn off AI coding assistant and start coding**. You'll **notice a pause every few seconds**. ThePrimeagen called this the copilot pause if I remember correctly. It's you **waiting for copilot** or whatever to hallucinate what is next. This by itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but then **what comes next? What was I supposed to do again**? How do I do this again? And you'll notice these questions aren't for some complex problem, but rather for a **simple language idiom that you've just forgotten from negligence**. 

# Differentiating Between What Is OK To Delegate To AI And What Not

There Is a simple rule of thumb. **Menial tasks get delegated, tasks that take critical thinking do not. If a task is essential for your work, never delegate**. 

You should **never delegate your understanding of a problem.** 

This is valid for people and for AI, **if you delegate a task, always do your own research** in parallel, come up with an approach and **validate against others or AI**.
