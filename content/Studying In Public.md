> Making private thoughts public.

There are lots of benefits to society, as well as to oneself, in **sharing opinions, knowledge, experiences and day-to-day**.

Artists share their art. 
Photographers their photos. 
Musicians their music. 
Writers their stories and books. 
Sculptors their creations. 
Developers [[Open Source]] their code. 

Yes, the note title may be a bit misleading, but the concept is similar in my mind. 

Studying, in the literal sense, in public can **improve productivity for people who find it hard to focus at home**. While there is a lot of hustle and bustle in public places, some people may find [[Calm From Chaos\|the chaos calming]]. I would argue that the home environment brings a lot more [[Distractions]] and [[Productivity Sinks]].

At the same time, there may be a middle ground. And having [[index\|a blog]] where I can share my thoughts is just that for me. 

So, that's why I call this studying in public.

*Personally what I share publicly I refine more because, as with everyone, [[Public Image]] is important to me.*
