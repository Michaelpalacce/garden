> [!success] ~ What ? ~
> Agile is a way of work, introduced in [[Japan]] in car manufacturing, that **was poorly translated** to fit the [[Software Development Life-cycle]]. Agile to me is a **horrible way to iterate on a problem**, that **Management thinks is good** and brings a lot of value to them, but the **drop in [[Productivity]] is not worth it**.
