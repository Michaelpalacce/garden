# [[Redundancy]] and [[Replication]]

- Eliminates single points of failure.
- Data replication across multiple Availability Zones or multi region deployments for cloud databases.
- RAID configurations and redundant hardware for on-premises systems.

# [[Backup]] and Recovery Strategies

- Defining clear [[Recovery Time Objective\|RTO]] and [[Recovery Point Objective\|RPO]] targets
- Automated backups and automated recovery procedures
- Regular testing restore procedures to ensure their efficacy

# [[Monitoring]] and [[Alerting]]

- Monitor key metrics
	- IOPS
	- Latency
	- Storage
	- Conencctions
	- Error Rates
	- CPU
	- Memory
- Setting up alerts for anomalies and threshold breaches allows for proactive intervention before na incident impacts users

# Performance Optimization

- Optimize queries
- Proper schema design
- Correct type of storage for the job

# Security

- Encrypt at rest and in transit.
- RBAC with [[Least Privilege Principle]]
