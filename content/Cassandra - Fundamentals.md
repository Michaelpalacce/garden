# Rack Aware

Cassandra is Rack aware, meaning that it will try to position data in different racks, so that during a rack failure, there will be no data loss.

# Highly Available

# No Single Point Of Failure

# Petabyte Database

# Geographic Distribution 

Data is replicated between different [[Cassandra - Datacenter\|Datacenters]] and they can be geographically in different places. Each Datacenter has 100% of the data, however data is NOT immediately replicated between datacenters.

# Linear Scalability

# Vendor Independent
