- **Spacing out practice between sessions** or **[[KIT/Interleaved And Varied Learning\|interleaving]] two or more subjects** while may seem less productive, actually **yields better results** than [[Massed Practice]]
- **Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution** leads to **better understanding** and and **better learning**.

- [[Testing Improves Learning]] when it's used as a tool to identify and bring up your areas of [[Weaknesses\|weakness]]
- Having a **solid foundation can help** you learn.
- ![[KIT/Elaboration]]
