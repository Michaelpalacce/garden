# Write down what needs to be done

Get a piece of paper or another medium and **note down what needs to happen today**. 

# Settle on the top priorities 

Not everything is equally important. **Prioritize** what needs to be **done today and ASAP**. 

# Create Time Slots to work on said priorities

**Create time slots** of **one hour** increments for things you need to be **focusing on**.
