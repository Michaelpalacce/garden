Money is truly everything in this [[Capitalism\|capitalistic]] world we live in, but in spite of all that I say screw it!

Don't work for money, work for [[Peace Of Mind]]. There will never be "enough" money, we are [[Envy\|envious]] and [[Greed\|greedy]].

Now I am not made of money and would not consider myself [[Economics\|economically rich]] by no means, but what I've had for a while now is a choice. A choice to forego my [[Family\|family]], my [[Sanity\|sanity]] and my personal [[Happiness\|happiness]] for wealth and I wonder if those who are financially well off had the same choice to make?

It may **seem like you've made a mistake** initially when you make this decision. You are [[Taking Risks\|encouraged to take risks]] and this was an argument I was making with myself, "Should I take this risk?" and "Does this matter to me?".

So **make the choice**, **choose to relax a little bit**, to **slow down and [[KIT/Reflection\|reflect]]** on what truly makes you happy, see if going for that extra dough will give you **peace of mind**, or will it **just stress you out more**? I still feel regret myself about some of the choices I've made and **I am writing this [[KIT/Write notes to your future self\|for me]], to remind myself that things are OK in this moment of clarity**.
