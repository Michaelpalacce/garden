# Learn The Syntax 

Best thing to do is take a [[Crash Course]] on the language itself. Nothing more than an hour maximum an hour and a half. 

**Play around the syntax of the language.** 

Don't stick around this step too much. You'll end up in [[Tutorial Hell]]. 

# Creating Your First App 

**Start off with something very simple**. It varies depending on the language itself, but create a simple [[CLI]] tool or perhaps a web page with a simple concept. 

# First Big Project 

**Do something you want/need**. Start your next project in this language. It doesn't need to be anything crazy, but go all in. 

- Make mistakes and [[KIT/Learning By Troubleshooting\|learn by troubleshooting]]
- Write [[Testing\|tests]] 
- Get familiar with [[Debugging]] tools
- Understsnd the common mistakes and [[Anti Patterns]] of the language.
- Play each language to it's strengths, don't assume that it will be the same as what you currently know about.

# Continue Working With The Language 

**This is really an important step.** 

Just 4 years as of writing this I used to be a great [[PHP]] developer, yet at this point I feel like I've forgotten everything. 

**Find time to [[KIT/Continuous Retrieval\|refresh your knowledge]] if you aim to be a [[Polyglot]].**
