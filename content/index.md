# Welcome!

You are entering a sorta blog, sorta Second Brain that will be shared publicly.

Check out [[KIT/000 Obsidian Index\|My KIT]] if you want to know more **how I take and structure notes**.

> [!warning]+ [[Work In Progress]]
> This is very much an [[Experiment\|experiment]] revolving around [[Studying In Public]]! I am still figuring out what I want to keep/change, so changes will be frequent.
> 
> **Some links may not work, as they may not be added yet. Assets may be missing. Dynamic data will not be loaded. Bases will not work. Etc.**
> 
> If you are interested in making it work, you can check the [github repo](https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/garden) where you can download the content and view them in [[KIT/000 Obsidian Index\|Obsidian]] directly.
