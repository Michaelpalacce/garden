# Action Items

- [ ] Fix Paperless
- [ ] Firefly fix for subscriptions 
- [ ] Info Inhibitor alerts should go to null
- [ ] Way to manage Proxmox security via Kubernetes? I wonder what are the best practices there? I don't want to use [[Terraform]], that has proven to be a bad idea.

# Withered

- [[HomeLab - Reverse Proxy With Swag]] - used to use SWAG, but went back to [[Nginx Proxy Manager]]
- [[Infrastructure As Code Migration]], was a dream, however I was disappointed by the official and community [[Terraform]] provider for [[Proxmox]].
