> Monitorability of an app refers to the **ability to observe, measure, and track the performance, health, and behavior** of the application in real-time or near-real-time. 

Key components of monitorability include:

1. **Metrics and Logs** - Collection of performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, response times) and logs (e.g., error logs, access logs). 
2. **Instrumentation** - Implementation of tools and techniques within the app to gather detailed data about it
	- This can include adding code to measure execution times, monitor resource usage, and track errors.
3. **[[Alerting]]** - Setting up alerts that notify developers or operations teams when certain thresholds are crossed or when specific issues occur
4. **[[Tracing]]** - Ability to trace the flow of requests through the app, often across multiple services or components
5. **Visualization** - Use of dashboards and visual tools to present the collected data
6. **Health Checks** - Automated checks that continually verify the app's functionality and availability
7. **Error Tracking** - Systematic recording and analysis of errors and exceptions
8. **User Monitoring**: Tracking user interactions and experiences
