[[@Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] the godfather of Flow, first coined the term.
[[@Steven Kotler]] has identified even more flow triggers. He focuses on the [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] side of flow.

# Flow Blockers 

**Loud and noisy environments** can lead to your [[Brain]] being extremely overloaded with information and not able to concentrate on the tasks at hand. 

**Social media** is full of [[Procrastination]] pits.

[[Ruining Development Flow]] is an integral problem for me, as a developer.

# Flow Proneness

Get to **work within 90 seconds of waking up.**

This seems like an extreme [[Workaholic|workaholic]] thing to do.

# Flow Triggers

Flow triggers contribute to:
1. How fast you enter flow
2. How deep you enter flow
3. How long you stay in flow

There are many triggers that let you enter a Flow state. Things like:
- **Gaming** *for me*
- Adrenaline Activities
- **Reading**  *for me*
- Playing An Instrument
- **Programming** *for me*

[[Clear Goals]] would let you keep a state of flow, since you have a clear "map" of what needs to be done.
**Immediate feedback** is crucial as well as the results are **immediately visible**. *This reminds me of [[Gambling|gambling]]. Like those addictive phone games?*
The **task is challenging** but you have **just the amount of skills** to actually tackle it.

# The Flow Cycle

## Struggle 

The task is challenging. You could be doing something better right now or relaxing. Why not procrastinate?

**Power Through!** You can try [[Attention Span Stretching|attention span stretching]]. **Do the work/activity** even if you **don't feel like doing** it. Do it in **increments of a few minutes** and at the end of each increment, **start another** one.

You can be **stuck in the struggle phase** of the flow cycle for probably most of the time. **This is the hardest part**.

## Release

You've overcome the task at hand. No matter how mundane, you've managed to push through the barrier. The task no longer feels like a struggle.

## Flow

You've **entered the flow state**.
